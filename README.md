- 👋 Hi, I’m @Triambak123
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, specifically computer vision and deep learning, and self-driving vehicles.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning as a broad field, and the parts of computer vision and deep learning have really piqued my interest in the subject. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that are related to machine learning, and am currently trying to experiment with different applications, instead of restricting myself to any one.
